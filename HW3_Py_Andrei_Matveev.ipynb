    "We will investigate the wine quality problem. The data are stored in 'winequality-red.csv'. The description of the data can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

Suppose we are intetered in classifying if the wine is good (quality greater than 5) or bad (quality less than or equal to 5). \n",

Split the data into training and testing parts using train_test_split (). Set the parameters so that $20\\%$ of the data are used as test data. Also set the random_state to 30, so that everyone gets the same splitting.\n",
